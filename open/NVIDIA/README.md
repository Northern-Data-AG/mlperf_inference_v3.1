# MLPerf Inference v3.1 NVIDIA-Optimized Implementations
This is a repository of NVIDIA-optimized implementations for the [MLPerf](https://mlcommons.org/en/) Inference Benchmark.

Please refer to the [README for our closed submissions](/closed/NVIDIA/README.md) for a quickstart tutorial on how to use our code as a public / external user.
This README contains information on the configurations, datasets, models, and benchmarks.

Note that you need to change `closed/NVIDIA` to `open/NVIDIA` in the instructions to use the open submissions.

For information on our open submissions for specific benchmarks (e.g. `bert`), please refer to the individual READMEs in the [open/NVIDIA/code/[benchmark]/tensorrt/README.md](/open/NVIDIA/code/) directories.
