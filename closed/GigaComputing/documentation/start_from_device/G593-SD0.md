# GIGABYTE G593-SD0 System Architecture

The GIGABYTE [G593-SD0](https://www.gigabyte.com/tw/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G593-SD0-rev-AAX1) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) RDMAâ„¢ technology, which allows for direct I/O from PCIe devices (e.g. a Host Channel Adapter) to GPU device memory.  Each H100 GPU in the system is connected to an NVIDIA CX-7 Infiniband 400 NDR NIC through a PCIe Gen5x16 connection

GigaComputing has measured approximately 49 GB/s per GPU in our internal measurement of P2P transfers between the NIC and the GPUs.
