# XE9680 System Architecture

The Dell PowerEdge [XE9680](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/servers/technical-support/poweredge-xe9680-spec-sheet.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) RDMAâ„¢ technology, which allows for direct I/O from PCIe devices (e.g. a Host Channel Adapter) to GPU device memory.  Each H100 GPU in the system is connected to an NVIDIA CX-7 Infiniband 400 NDR NIC through a PCIe Gen5x16 connection.

Dell has measured approximately 49.5 GB/s per GPU in our internal measurement of P2P transfers between the NIC and the GPUs, which is enough to serve all benchmarks and scenarios.
