This is a fork of the official MLPerfâ„¢ Inference v3.1 repository with changes to seamlessly run on Taiga Cloud machines.

The changes are made directly inside [NVIDIA's submission](closed/NVIDIA) as closest to our platform.

This repository is not meant to be or become an official benchmark submission.

Following the [MLPerf Results Messaging Guidelines](https://github.com/mlcommons/policies/blob/master/MLPerf_Results_Messaging_Guidelines.adoc), all our results are not verified by MLCommons Association and when presenting we must accompany the numbers with a required text or footnote.
